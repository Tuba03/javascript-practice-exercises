# JavaScript Practice Exercise 🚀

This repository is a collection of hands-on exercises I built to learn and reinforce my understanding of core JavaScript concepts. Each file focuses on a specific topic like variables, arrays, DOM events, functions, animations, and operators.

These practice snippets are beginner-friendly and written to explore the fundamentals of JavaScript through interactive browser-based examples.

## 📁 What's Included

| Topic             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `JS Variable/`    | Declares and prints variables like `name`, `age`, and `salary` using `document.write()`. |
| `JS Operators/`   | Demonstrates arithmetic, assignment, comparison, unary, and ternary operators. Uses `prompt()` and `alert()` for input/output. |
| `JS functions/`   | Collects user input from form fields and displays a message using a custom function. |
| `JS animations/`  | Creates an image slider using `setInterval()` and pauses animation on mouse hover. |
| `JS Events/`      | Changes the image source on `mouseover` and `mouseout` using inline JavaScript event handlers. |
| `JS Objects/`     | Defines a JavaScript object and uses a `for...in` loop to iterate through its properties. |
| `JS Arrays/`      | Implements a basic **bubble sort** algorithm to sort numeric arrays and prints before/after values. |

## 🔍 Key Concepts Practiced

- ✅ Variables and data types
- ✅ Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
- ✅ DOM manipulation using `document.write()` *(to be refactored to `innerHTML`)*
- ✅ Functions and event handlers
- ✅ `prompt()` and `alert()` usage
- ✅ Object literals and loops
- ✅ Bubble sort with nested loops
- ✅ Image swapping on events (`mouseover`, `mouseout`)
- ✅ Animation using timers

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tuba03/JavaScript
2. Open any .html file in a browser.

3. Interact with forms, hover over images, or enter input where prompted.

4. Use browser console for logs and document.write() output.


## 📚 Why I Created This
While learning JavaScript, I realized that coding hands-on examples solidifies understanding much better than passive reading. This repo documents my practice journey and serves as a reference for common syntax and logic patterns.

| Technology               | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **HTML5**                | Used to create the structure of the pages and forms for input/output testing.                                                     |
| **CSS (basic)**          | Used for minimal styling (if added later), though current examples are mostly HTML+JS.                                            |
| **JavaScript (Vanilla)** | Core language used for all logic, including DOM manipulation, functions, loops, operators, events, and animations.                |
| **Browser APIs**         | Used features like `document.write()`, `prompt()`, `alert()`, `onmouseover`, `onmouseout`, `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()`. |
| **DOM Manipulation**     | Accessing and modifying HTML elements and attributes via JavaScript.                                                              |
