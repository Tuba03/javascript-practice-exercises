# JavaScript Learning Playground 🌐✨

This repository contains a collection of hands-on JavaScript exercises that I’ve written to practice and strengthen my understanding of core frontend concepts. These files cover everything from variables and functions to DOM events and animations.

## 📁 Contents

| Topic             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `JS Variable/`    | Practice with variable declarations using `var`, `let`, and `const`. Covers scope, hoisting, and initialization. |
| `JS Operators/`   | Demonstrates use of arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators in JavaScript. |
| `JS Arrays/`      | Covers array creation, methods (`push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter`, etc.), and iteration techniques. |
| `JS Objects/`     | Shows how to define and access objects, use nested structures, and iterate over keys/values. |
| `JS functions/`   | Practice with function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and parameter handling. |
| `JS Events/`      | Demonstrates event listeners such as `click`, `mouseover`, `keydown`, and how to use them with DOM elements. |

3. Use browser console or VS Code Live Server to view output and behavior.

📚 Why I Created This
While learning JavaScript, I realized that coding hands-on examples solidifies understanding much better than passive reading. This repo documents my practice journey and serves as a reference for common syntax and logic patterns.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
JavaScript

HTML (for testing DOM/Event concepts)

Chrome DevTools for debugging and output
